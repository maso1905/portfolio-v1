    p1: 'I’m a recent Web Development gradute from Mid Sweden University. Like birds loves their sky, I love being in a creative environment. Creativity can be a lot of things, for me it means to be a part of something small that evolves into something greater. That’s why I love coding, it’s scaleable and powerful!',
    p2: ' I would define myself as a structured and dedicated person who loves to learn. I have a musical background, playing the guitar in highschool and some piano. Since an early age I’ve also had an affinity for video games - it started when I was 11 years old.. I used to beat my friends in Tekken 3, most likely by pressing all the buttons as fast as I could rather than devine and elegant technique. Maybe I’m slightly competitive still, but now in my adult years it’s less about winning and more being ambitious and a solid teamplayer.'
